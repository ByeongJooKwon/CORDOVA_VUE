# cordova-plugin-aplexa-keyboard

This is a fork of cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard with the puropse of avoiding conflict with https://w3c.github.io/keyboard-lock/

This plugin has been designed to work seamlessly with `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview`, so make sure you have it installed first:

 - https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview
 - https://ionicframework.com/docs/wkwebview/

## Installation

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-aplexa-keyboard --save
```

## Preferences

### KeyboardResize

> Boolean (true by default)

#### Possible values
- `true`: Showing/hiding the keyboard will trigger some kind of resizing of the app (see KeyboardResizeMode)
- `false`: Web will not be resized when the keyboard shows up.

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardResize" value="true" />
```

### KeyboardResizeMode

> String ('native' by default)

#### Possible values

- `native`: The whole native webview will be resized when the keyboard shows/hides, it will affect the `vh` relative unit.
- `body`: Only the html `<body>` element will be resized. Relative units are not affected, because the viewport does not change.
- `ionic`: Only the html `ion-app` element will be resized. Only for ionic apps.

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardResizeMode" value="native" />
```
